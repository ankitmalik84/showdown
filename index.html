            <h1>Taj Mahal</h1>
            <p>
              The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank
              of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was
              commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (
              1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.

            <p>
              Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643,
              but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10
              years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in
              its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around
              ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion
              (about US $1 billion). The construction project employed some
              20,000 artisans. The plinth and tomb took some 12 years to
              complete.

        <h2>Facts</h2>
        <p>
          1. The Taj Mahal was created by Emperor Shah Jahan for his favorite
          wife Mumtaz Mahal. <br />
          2. The Taj Mahal's color changes constantly throughout the day.<br />
          3. Jahan's grave breaks the perfect symmetry of the Taj Mahal.The
          placing of the cenotaph of Shah Jahan — and his grave — are perhaps
          the only elements of the Taj that do not follow perfect geometric
          proportions and symmetrical precision.
